## Golang 3-Day Mastery Plan for Implementing a Time-Series Database Engine

This 3-day plan is designed to help you master essential Golang concepts through hands-on practice and targeted learning. The plan is divided into three focused days, each with specific goals and tasks to help you build a strong foundation in Go.

### Day 1: Core Language and Data Structures

#### Morning (3 hours)
- [x] **Values, Variables, Constants, For, If/Else, Switch**
  - [x] Review basic syntax and control flow.
  - [x] Practice examples and exercises.
- [x] **Functions, Multiple Return Values, Variadic Functions**
  - [x] Study function definitions and multiple return values.
  - [x] Implement simple and variadic functions.

#### Afternoon (3 hours)
- [x] **Arrays, Slices, Maps**
  - [x] Learn about array and slice operations.
  - [x] Understand map creation, insertion, and retrieval.
- [ ] **Pointers, Structs, Methods, Struct Embedding**
  - [ ] Review how to use pointers.
  - [ ] Practice defining and using structs, methods, and struct embedding.


#### Evening (2 hours)
- [ ] **Interfaces, Generics**
  - [ ] Study the definition and implementation of interfaces.
  - [ ] Practice creating generic types and functions.
- [ ] **Review and Practice**
  - [ ] Solve practice problems on the above topics.
  - [ ] Write small programs that integrate multiple concepts.

### QUESTIONS :

### Arrays, Slices, Maps

#### Array and Slice Operations
Write a function that takes an array of integers and returns a new slice containing only the even numbers from the array. Then, write another function that appends a given integer to this slice.

#### Map Creation, Insertion, and Retrieval
Create a map to store the names and ages of several people. Write a function to add a new person to the map and another function to retrieve a person's age by their name.

### Pointers, Structs, Methods, Struct Embedding

#### Using Pointers
Write a function that takes a pointer to an integer and doubles its value.

#### Structs, Methods, and Struct Embedding
Define a `Person` struct with fields for name and age. Embed this struct in an `Employee` struct that also has a field for the employee's position. Write a method for the `Employee` struct that prints a greeting message.

## Evening (2 hours)

### Interfaces, Generics

#### Interfaces
Define an interface `Shape` with a method `Area`. Create two structs, `Circle` and `Rectangle`, that implement this interface. Write a function that takes a `Shape` and prints its area.

#### Generics
Write a generic function that finds the maximum value in a slice of any ordered type (integers, floats, etc.).

### Review and Practice

#### Practice Problem
Combine the above concepts to write a small program where you define a `Student` struct with fields for name and grades (a slice of integers). Implement a method to calculate the average grade, and use an interface to define behavior for different types of students (e.g., `RegularStudent` and `HonorStudent`).
```

### Day 2: Concurrency and Advanced Data Handling

#### Morning (3 hours)
- [ ] **Goroutines, Channels, Channel Buffering, Channel Synchronization, Channel Directions**
  - [ ] Understand the basics of concurrency in Go.
  - [ ] Practice creating goroutines and using channels for communication.
- [ ] **Select, Timeouts, Non-Blocking Channel Operations**
  - [ ] Learn how to use `select` for multiple channel operations.
  - [ ] Implement timeouts and non-blocking operations.

#### Afternoon (3 hours)
- [ ] **Timers, Tickers, Worker Pools, WaitGroups**
  - [ ] Study timers and tickers for scheduling.
  - [ ] Implement a worker pool and use `sync.WaitGroup` for synchronization.
- [ ] **Rate Limiting, Atomic Counters, Mutexes, Stateful Goroutines**
  - [ ] Learn rate limiting techniques and managing shared state.
  - [ ] Practice creating stateful goroutines.

#### Evening (2 hours)
- [ ] **Sorting, Sorting by Functions**
  - [ ] Review sorting algorithms and custom function sorting.
  - [ ] Implement sorting for different data types.
- [ ] **Review and Practice**
  - [ ] Solve concurrency-related problems.
  - [ ] Write concurrent programs that integrate the above concepts.

### Day 3: Error Handling, File Handling, and Miscellaneous

#### Morning (3 hours)
- [ ] **Errors, Custom Errors**
  - [ ] Study Go’s error handling paradigm.
  - [ ] Practice creating and handling custom errors.
- [ ] **Reading Files, Writing Files, File Paths, Directories, Temporary Files and Directories**
  - [ ] Learn file I/O operations and directory management.
  - [ ] Implement programs that read from and write to files.

#### Afternoon (3 hours)
- [ ] **JSON, Time, Epoch, Time Formatting / Parsing**
  - [ ] Understand JSON encoding/decoding.
  - [ ] Work with time-related functions and format/parsing.
- [ ] **HTTP Client, HTTP Server, Context**
  - [ ] Study how to create HTTP clients and servers.
  - [ ] Learn how to use the `context` package for managing request lifetimes.

#### Evening (2 hours)
- [ ] **Testing and Benchmarking**
  - [ ] Review how to write unit tests and benchmarks in Go.
  - [ ] Practice testing and benchmarking your code.
- [ ] **Review and Practice**
  - [ ] Work on integrating file handling, error handling, and concurrency.
  - [ ] Write a mini-project or set of programs that combine multiple concepts.

### Tips for Effective Learning
- **Hands-On Practice**: Spend more time coding and less time reading. Practical experience is key.
- **Small Projects**: Implement small projects or tasks that utilize the concepts you've learned each day.
- **Review and Refactor**: At the end of each day, review what you've learned and refactor your code for better understanding and efficiency.
- **Resources**: Utilize Go’s official documentation, tutorials, and online resources like Go by Example and The Go Programming Language book.

By following this plan, you should gain a solid understanding of the essential Golang concepts needed to develop a time-series database engine. Happy coding!
