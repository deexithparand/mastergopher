   - Review and practice basic syntax and control flow.
   - Work through examples and exercises.

2. **Functions, Multiple Return Values, Variadic Functions**
   - Study function definitions, calls, and multiple return values.
   - Implement simple and variadic functions.

#### Afternoon (3 hours)
3. **Arrays, Slices, Maps**
   - Learn about array and slice operations, including iteration and manipulation.
   - Understand map creation, insertion, and retrieval.

4. **Pointers, Structs, Methods, Struct Embedding**
   - Review how to use pointers and why they are important.
   - Practice defining and using structs, methods, and struct embedding.

#### Evening (2 hours)
5. **Interfaces, Generics**
   - Study the definition and implementation of interfaces.
   - Practice creating generic types and functions.

6. **Review and Practice**
   - Solve practice problems on the above topics.
   - Write small programs that integrate multiple concepts.

### Day 2: Concurrency and Advanced Data Handling

#### Morning (3 hours)
1. **Goroutines, Channels, Channel Buffering, Channel Synchronization, Channel Directions**
   - Understand the basics of concurrency in Go.
   - Practice creating goroutines and using channels for communication.

2. **Select, Timeouts, Non-Blocking Channel Operations**
   - Learn how to use `select` to handle multiple channel operations.
   - Implement timeouts and non-blocking operations.

#### Afternoon (3 hours)
3. **Timers, Tickers, Worker Pools, WaitGroups**
   - Study timers and tickers for scheduling.
   - Implement a worker pool and use `sync.WaitGroup` for synchronization.

4. **Rate Limiting, Atomic Counters, Mutexes, Stateful Goroutines**
   - Learn rate limiting techniques and how to manage shared state using mutexes and atomic operations.
   - Practice creating stateful goroutines.

#### Evening (2 hours)
5. **Sorting, Sorting by Functions**
   - Review sorting algorithms and how to sort by custom functions.
   - Implement sorting for different data types.

6. **Review and Practice**
   - Solve concurrency-related problems.
   - Write concurrent programs that integrate the above concepts.

### Day 3: Error Handling, File Handling, and Miscellaneous

#### Morning (3 hours)
1. **Errors, Custom Errors**
   - Study Go’s error handling paradigm.
   - Practice creating and handling custom errors.

2. **Reading Files, Writing Files, File Paths, Directories, Temporary Files and Directories**
   - Learn file I/O operations and directory management.
   - Implement programs that read from and write to files.

#### Afternoon (3 hours)
3. **JSON, Time, Epoch, Time Formatting / Parsing**
   - Understand JSON encoding/decoding.
   - Work with time-related functions and format/parsing.

4. **HTTP Client, HTTP Server, Context**
   - Study how to create HTTP clients and servers.
   - Learn how to use the `context` package for managing request lifetimes.

#### Evening (2 hours)
5. **Testing and Benchmarking**
   - Review how to write unit tests and benchmarks in Go.
   - Practice testing and benchmarking your code.

6. **Review and Practice**
   - Work on integrating file handling, error handling, and concurrency.
   - Write a mini-project or set of programs that combine multiple concepts.

### Tips for Effective Learning
- **Hands-On Practice**: Spend more time coding and less time reading. Practical experience is key.
- **Small Projects**: Implement small projects or tasks that utilize the concepts you've learned each day.
- **Review and Refactor**: At the end of each day, review what you've learned and refactor your code for better understanding and efficiency.
- **Resources**: Utilize Go’s official documentation, tutorials, and online resources like Go by Example and The Go Programming Language book.

By following this plan, you should gain a solid understanding of the essential Golang concepts needed to develop a time-series database engine.
