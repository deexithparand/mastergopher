  - [ ] Implement timeouts and non-blocking operations.

#### Afternoon (3 hours)
- [ ] **Timers, Tickers, Worker Pools, WaitGroups**
  - [ ] Study timers and tickers for scheduling.
  - [ ] Implement a worker pool and use `sync.WaitGroup` for synchronization.

  - [ ] Learn rate limiting techniques and managing shared state.
  - [ ] Practice creating stateful goroutines.

#### Evening (2 hours)
- [ ] **Sorting, Sorting by Functions**
  - [ ] Review sorting algorithms and custom function sorting.
  - [ ] Implement sorting for different data types.
- [ ] **Review and Practice**
  - [ ] Solve concurrency-related problems.
  - [ ] Write concurrent programs that integrate the above concepts.

### Day 3: Error Handling, File Handling, and Miscellaneous

#### Morning (3 hours)
- [ ] **Errors, Custom Errors**
  - [ ] Study Go’s error handling paradigm.
  - [ ] Practice creating and handling custom errors.
- [ ] **Reading Files, Writing Files, File Paths, Directories, Temporary Files and Directories**
  - [ ] Learn file I/O operations and directory management.
  - [ ] Implement programs that read from and write to files.

#### Afternoon (3 hours)
- [ ] **JSON, Time, Epoch, Time Formatting / Parsing**
  - [ ] Understand JSON encoding/decoding.
  - [ ] Work with time-related functions and format/parsing.
- [ ] **HTTP Client, HTTP Server, Context**
  - [ ] Study how to create HTTP clients and servers.
  - [ ] Learn how to use the `context` package for managing request lifetimes.

#### Evening (2 hours)
- [ ] **Testing and Benchmarking**
  - [ ] Review how to write unit tests and benchmarks in Go.
  - [ ] Practice testing and benchmarking your code.
- [ ] **Review and Practice**
  - [ ] Work on integrating file handling, error handling, and concurrency.
  - [ ] Write a mini-project or set of programs that combine multiple concepts.

### Tips for Effective Learning
- **Hands-On Practice**: Spend more time coding and less time reading. Practical experience is key.
- **Small Projects**: Implement small projects or tasks that utilize the concepts you've learned each day.
- **Review and Refactor**: At the end of each day, review what you've learned and refactor your code for better understanding and efficiency.
- **Resources**: Utilize Go’s official documentation, tutorials, and online resources like Go by Example and The Go Programming Language book.

By following this plan, you should gain a solid understanding of the essential Golang concepts needed to develop a time-series database engine. Happy coding!
